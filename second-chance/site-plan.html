			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
                I am revamping a past version that I made, mostly focusing on more functionality and asethetic appeal.This website is for a nonprofit that my dad is going to startup, which functions as a way for children in the foster system to save up money for college. This is done by rebuilding and fixing up jeeps with a foster child, and once the jeep is fixed it is sold and used as scholarship money. 
            </p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
                The audience of the website that I am focusing in on is those that could add to the non-profit through ways like donations and similar actions. For people that want to help in the organization, this website is what they will work/contact through and find info about past projects and the trajectory of Second Chance.
            </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The first main dynamic element that I am adding is an interactive image carousel for past projects. Users will be able to flip through to see a main picture of a past project, then click to see more information on it. I'm changing the data to make it dynamic, so that new projects can be added to the website easily. If I have time I'm also going to add a forum for those reaching out to runners of Second Chance.</p>

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
